\title{Why Historical Truth Matters to Mathematicians: Dispelling Myths While
Promoting Maths}
\speaker{Judy Grabiner, Pomona College}

\abstract{%
I'll recount seven myths about the development of mathematics that I
have encountered in my career as a historian of mathematics.  For
instance, here's one you have probably encountered, too: It is often
said that Newton developed the calculus just to do his physics.

The examples I'll discuss range from antiquity to the twentieth
century.  I hope to provide a more accurate (and more interesting!)
store for each.  I will also explain what is at stake in getting each
of them right: the general point is that it helps us understand the
way mathematics actually develops and thus how to make our own work
more fruitful---and better appreciated by the rest of humanity.
